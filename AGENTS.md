## Authoritative Sources

- **DNA (requirements)**: DNA.md (internal)
- **Research (approaches)**: research notes (internal)
- **Reference implementation**: github.com/steipete/oracle (for ideas only, not template)

## Testing

Use real ChatGPT freely:
- GPT-5.2 Instant — cheap, fast, use for UI testing
- GPT-5.2 / GPT-5.2 Thinking — for longer flow tests
- GPT-5.2 Pro — only for final validation, sparingly

Don't be conservative. Test against real interface. Iterate until it works.
